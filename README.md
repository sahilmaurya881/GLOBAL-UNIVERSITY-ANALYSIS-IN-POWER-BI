# Project Components

## 1. MECE Approach Documentation (Word)

- **File Name:** MECE_Breakdown.docx
- **Description:** Uncover the logic behind the process! This guide provides a closer look at how datasets are systematically analyzed using the MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) method.

### Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive (MECE) Approach

![mece](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sahilmaurya881/GLOBAL-UNIVERSITY-ANALYSIS-IN-POWER-BI/c1a674043ebca32a33f610c719d57f3645932c5c/Assets/mece.png)

*The MECE diagram outlines the structured approach applied in dissecting and evaluating the dataset. This method ensures that every component is distinct (Mutually Exclusive) while covering all possibilities (Collectively Exhaustive). It serves as the foundation for uncovering valuable insights and patterns across various dimensions, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the data.*



## 2 Power BI University Success Analysis (Power BI)

- **File Name:** PowerBI_University_Success_Analysis.pbix
- **Description:** Harness the capabilities of Power BI! This file addresses problem statements, visualizes data, and constructs dashboards for a comprehensive view of university rankings.

### Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram
